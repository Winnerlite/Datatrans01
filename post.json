    "content": "<p>Traveling by road in Nigeria requires smart planning. While new highways are being built, safety remains the #1 concern for travelers from Lagos to Abuja, Port Harcourt, and beyond. Here are the 5 non-negotiable rules for safe travel in 2026.</p> <h3>1. Choose Companies with Vehicle Tracking</h3> <p>Not all 'transport companies' are the same. We strongly recommend booking with established operators like <a href='/brand.html?name=God%20is%20Good%20Motors' class='text-[#1acd81] underline'>GIGM (God is Good Motors)</a> or <i>GUO Transport</i>. Why? Because they use <b>real-time vehicle tracking</b>. If a bus breaks down or goes off-route, their HQ knows immediately.</p> <img src='https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1570125909232-eb263c188f7e?auto=format&fit=crop&q=80&w=800' class='w-full rounded-xl my-6' alt='Modern bus terminal in Nigeria'> <h3>2. The '6 AM Rule' (Avoid Night Travel)</h3> <p>While night buses are often cheaper, they are significantly <b>riskier</b> due to poor visibility and security issues on highways like the Ore-Benin express. Always book the first bus (6:00 AM - 7:00 AM). You can <a href='/' class='text-[#1acd81] underline'>check morning departure prices here</a>.</p> <h3>3. Seat Selection Matters</h3> <p>Did you know the safest seat in a Toyota Hiace is usually in the middle row, aisle side? Avoid the seat directly next to the driver (the 'death seat') and the very back row, which feels the most impact from potholes.</p> <h3>4. Share Your Live Location</h3> <p>Before you leave the terminal, send your <b>Manifest ID</b> (printed on your ticket) and your live WhatsApp location to a family member. Established parks take passenger manifests seriously—roadside buses do not.</p> <h3>5. Carry Cash (But Not Too Much)</h3> <p>ATM networks can be unreliable at rest stops in Lokoja or Ore. Keep N5,000 - N10,000 in smaller notes for food, but keep your main funds on your card.</p> <div class='bg-slate-800 p-6 rounded-xl border-l-4 border-[#1acd81] my-8'> <h4 class='text-white font-bold mb-2'>Planning a Trip?</h4> <p class='text-sm text-slate-400'>Don't just guess the price.

    "content": "<p>The Lagos to Abuja route is the busiest travel corridor in Nigeria. Whether you are traveling for business or Japa plans, prices fluctuate wildly depending on the vehicle type (Sienna vs. Coaster) and the terminal location (Jibowu vs. Iyana Ipaja).</p> <h3>Current Price Ranges (2026 Estimates)</h3> <ul class='list-disc pl-5 space-y-2 mb-6'> <li><b>Luxury Bus (Marcopolo):</b> NGN 35,000 - N45,000</li> <li><b>Toyota Sienna (AC):</b> NGN 45,000 - N55,000</li> <li><b>Coaster/Hummer Bus:</b> NGN 25,000 - N32,000</li> </ul> <p><i>Note: Prices change daily based on fuel costs. Use our <a href='/route.html?from=Lagos&to=Abuja' class='text-[#1acd81] underline'>Search Tool</a> for today's live rates.</i></p> <h3>1. GIGM (God is Good Motors)</h3> <p>GIGM is the premium choice. Their 'Prime' terminals in Jibowu and Ikeja offer air-conditioned waiting rooms. Expect to pay a premium, but their fleet is the newest on the road. Safety rating: <b>9/10</b>.</p> <h3>2. GUO Transport</h3> <p>GUO is the king of the East, but their Lagos-Abuja route is excellent. They are often N2,000 - N3,000 cheaper than GIGM and allow more luggage allowance. Great for traders.</p> <img src='https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1469854523086-cc02fe5d8800?auto=format&fit=crop&q=80&w=800' class='w-full rounded-xl my-6' alt='Bus traveling on highway'> <h3>3. ABC Transport</h3> <p>If comfort is your priority, ABC's 'Sleeper' buses are legendary. They take longer because they adhere to strict speed limits (which is a good thing for safety). Read our <a href='read.html?post=how-to-travel-safely-nigeria' class='text-[#1acd81] underline'>Guide on Travel Safety</a> to see why speed limits matter.</p> <h3>Verdict: Who should you choose?</h3> <p>If you have a tight budget, look for <b>Young Shall Grow</b> or smaller operators at Jibowu. If you prioritize speed and AC, stick to <b>GIGM Sienna</b>.</p> <div class='mt-8 pt-8 border-t border-slate-800 text-center'> <p class='mb-4 text-white font-bold'>Ready to book?</p> <a href='/route.html?from=Lagos&to=Abuja' class='bg-[#1acd81] text-black px-6 py-3 rounded-full font-bold hover:scale-105 transition-transform'>Compare Lagos to Abuja Prices</a> </div>"
